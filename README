The objective of this project is to identify the most similar images from a given dataset compared to a test image. This is achieved through the calculation of Euclidean distances between the images in the dataset and the test image. The dataset comprises images of celebrities, and the task involves finding the closest matches to a given test image. This process is demonstrated using the nearest neighbor (1-NN, 3-NN, and 5-NN) methods to find the most similar images.
